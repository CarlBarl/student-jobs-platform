# Job Data Collection Legal Compliance Guide

This document outlines the legal and compliance considerations for the Student Jobs Platform's job data collection framework. It provides guidance on web scraping regulations, GDPR compliance, and best practices for ethical data collection.

## Web Scraping Legal Framework in Sweden/EU

Web scraping exists in a legal gray area in many jurisdictions, including Sweden and the EU. While there is no specific law that explicitly prohibits web scraping, several legal frameworks affect its practice:

### 1. Copyright Law

**Relevant Legislation**: Swedish Copyright Act (1960:729), EU Copyright Directive

**Considerations**:
- Published job listings are generally considered factual information, which is typically not protected by copyright
- The format, layout, and creative descriptions may be protected by copyright
- The EU Database Directive provides "sui generis" protection for databases that represent substantial investment

**Compliance Approach**:
- Store only the factual information about jobs, not the entire HTML structure
- Transform and normalize the data rather than directly reproducing it
- Document attribution of all data sources
- Do not scrape or store images, logos, or other creative content without permission

### 2. Computer Misuse and Unauthorized Access

**Relevant Legislation**: Swedish Penal Code Chapter 4, Article 9c, EU Cybercrime Convention

**Considerations**:
- Bypassing technical measures designed to prevent scraping may constitute unauthorized access
- Causing service disruption through intensive scraping could potentially be considered a form of computer misuse

**Compliance Approach**:
- Respect `robots.txt` directives (see Technical Measures section)
- Never circumvent CAPTCHAs, IP blocks, or other access control measures
- Implement rate limiting and delay between requests to prevent server strain
- Avoid any attempt to disguise the scraper's identity beyond what's necessary for normal operation

### 3. Terms of Service

**Considerations**:
- Many websites explicitly prohibit scraping in their Terms of Service
- Breaching Terms of Service could potentially constitute a breach of contract

**Compliance Approach**:
- Review Terms of Service for each target website
- Only scrape sites where the Terms of Service do not explicitly prohibit it
- For important sources with restrictive Terms of Service, consider reaching out for permission
- Document compliance decisions for each data source

### 4. Unfair Competition Law

**Relevant Legislation**: Swedish Marketing Act, EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive

**Considerations**:
- Using scraped data to directly compete with the source website could potentially constitute unfair competition
- Misrepresenting the source of data could be considered misleading marketing

**Compliance Approach**:
- Clearly state data sources in the application
- Ensure the platform adds substantial value beyond simply aggregating listings
- Implement source attribution for all job listings
- Consider affiliate or partnership programs with key job listing sites

## GDPR Compliance

As the job listings may contain personal information (e.g., contact details for hiring managers), GDPR compliance is essential.

### 1. Data Minimization

**Considerations**:
- Only collect personal data necessary for the platform's purpose
- Avoid storing unnecessary personal information

**Implementation**:
- Only extract job-related information, not personal details of posting individuals
- Remove or anonymize contact details that identify specific people
- Store company email addresses (e.g., `careers@company.com`) rather than personal ones
- Document data minimization decisions in the source adapter configuration

### 2. Purpose Limitation

**Considerations**:
- Only use collected data for the stated purpose of helping students find relevant jobs
- Avoid secondary uses without appropriate legal basis

**Implementation**:
- Define clear purpose limitation in the data collection framework
- Create an audit trail of how job data is used throughout the system
- Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized use of the data

### 3. Storage Limitation

**Considerations**:
- Do not keep job listings longer than necessary
- Establish clear retention periods

**Implementation**:
- Implement automatic removal of expired job listings
- Define retention periods based on job application deadlines
- Archive or anonymize old listings rather than keeping them indefinitely
- Create automated data lifecycle management

### 4. Transparency

**Considerations**:
- Be transparent about data collection methods
- Inform users about the sources of job listings

**Implementation**:
- Clearly state data sources for each job listing
- Provide a link to the original job posting
- Include a data collection disclosure in the privacy policy
- Make the privacy policy easily accessible from all pages

### 5. Data Subject Rights

**Considerations**:
- Respect the rights of data subjects whose personal data may be included in job listings
- Establish procedures for handling data subject requests

**Implementation**:
- Create a contact mechanism for data removal requests
- Establish procedures for timely removal of personal data upon request
- Document all data subject requests and responses

## Technical Measures for Ethical Scraping

### 1. Respecting robots.txt

**Implementation**:
- Check the `robots.txt` file before scraping any website
- Parse and follow directives regarding allowed/disallowed paths
- Respect any crawl-delay parameter
- Document robots.txt compliance for each source
- Implement automatic checking of robots.txt changes
- Log robots.txt policy changes for review

```typescript
// Example code for robots.txt compliance
import robotsParser from 'robots-parser';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

async function isAllowedToScrape(url: string, userAgent: string): Promise<boolean> {
  try {
    const parsedUrl = new URL(url);
    const robotsUrl = `${parsedUrl.protocol}//${parsedUrl.hostname}/robots.txt`;
    
    const response = await fetch(robotsUrl);
    const robotsTxt = await response.text();
    
    const robots = robotsParser(robotsUrl, robotsTxt);
    return robots.isAllowed(url, userAgent);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error checking robots.txt:', error);
    return false; // Default to not allowed if there's an error
  }
}
```

### 2. Rate Limiting and Politeness

**Implementation**:
- Implement significant delays between requests (e.g., 1-10 seconds)
- Use a concurrency limit to prevent too many parallel requests
- Adjust rate limiting based on the website's size and capacity
- Implement exponential backoff when receiving error responses
- Schedule scraping during off-peak hours
- Distribute collection across time to minimize impact

### 3. Identification and Transparency

**Implementation**:
- Use a descriptive User-Agent string that identifies the scraper
- Include contact information in the User-Agent
- Do not attempt to masquerade as a regular browser
- Consider registering the scraper bot with major websites

Example User-Agent:
```
Student-Jobs-Platform-Bot/1.0 (+https://studentjobsplatform.com/bot; bot@studentjobsplatform.com)
```

### 4. Cache and Conditional Requests

**Implementation**:
- Use HTTP conditional requests (If-Modified-Since, ETag)
- Implement a caching strategy to reduce unnecessary requests
- Only re-scrape pages that have likely changed
- Implement fingerprinting to detect content changes efficiently
- Store and compare ETags when available

### 5. Error Handling and Resilience

**Implementation**:
- Respect HTTP status codes (especially 429 Too Many Requests)
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Detect and handle CAPTCHA or anti-bot challenges without attempting to bypass them
- Log and alert on scraping errors for manual review
- Gracefully degrade functionality when a source becomes unavailable

## Compliance Documentation and Monitoring

### 1. Source-Specific Compliance Documentation

For each data source, maintain documentation including:

- Terms of Service review date and compliance assessment
- Robots.txt policy
- Rate limiting configuration
- Any communication or permission from the website owner
- Risk assessment
- Data retention policy

### 2. Regular Compliance Audits

- Conduct quarterly reviews of scraping practices
- Update documentation for any changes in source websites' policies
- Review logs for compliance violations
- Update scraping parameters based on audit findings

### 3. Incident Response Procedure

- Define clear steps for responding to complaints
- Establish a process for temporarily suspending scraping of specific sources
- Document all complaints and responses
- Create escalation paths for serious compliance concerns

## Compliance Checklist for Adding New Sources

Before adding a new job listing source to the collection framework, complete this checklist:

1. Review Terms of Service for scraping prohibitions
2. Check robots.txt for scraping permissions
3. Assess the personal data included in job listings
4. Document the legal basis for collecting the data
5. Configure appropriate rate limiting based on site size
6. Test scraping on a small sample to assess impact
7. Implement source-specific data retention rules
8. Add attribution mechanism for the new source
9. Document the compliance assessment

## External APIs vs. Web Scraping

When available, prefer official APIs over web scraping:

### JobTech API

The Swedish Public Employment Service (Arbetsf√∂rmedlingen) provides the JobTech API, which should be the primary source of job data. Using this API:

- Is explicitly permitted and encouraged
- Provides structured data designed for consumption
- Avoids legal gray areas of web scraping
- Is more stable and less prone to breaking changes
- Typically provides more comprehensive data

### Legal Hierarchy for Data Collection

Follow this priority order for job data sources:

1. Official APIs with explicit permission (e.g., JobTech API)
2. Sites with open data policies that explicitly allow scraping
3. Sites without scraping prohibitions in robots.txt or Terms of Service
4. Sites where permission has been obtained through direct contact
5. *Avoid*: Sites that explicitly prohibit scraping
